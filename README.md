### **Q4) What are Intelligent Agents? What are Key Components? (6 Marks)**

**Answer:**
An **Intelligent Agent** is a system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve goals.
🧩 **Example:** Self-driving car adjusting speed automatically.

**Key Components:**

1. **Perception:** Sensors or input that detect environment data.
2. **Reasoning:** Processing and making logical decisions.
3. **Learning:** Improves performance from past experience.
4. **Action:** Performs actions using actuators or outputs.

**Formula:**
Intelligent Agent = Perception + Reasoning + Learning + Action

### **Q5) What are the Different Types of Intelligent Agents? (6 Marks)**

**Answer:**
AI agents can be classified based on capability and intelligence.
🤖 **Types:**

1. **Simple Reflex Agents:**

   * Act only on current input.
   * Example: Thermostat.
2. **Model-Based Reflex Agents:**

   * Use past data (history) to make decisions.
3. **Goal-Based Agents:**

   * Act to achieve specific goals.
4. **Utility-Based Agents:**

   * Choose actions for maximum satisfaction or performance.
5. **Learning Agents:**

   * Learn and improve with experience (e.g., AI assistants).

### **Q6) What are the Different Types of Agent Environments? (6 Marks)**

**Answer:**
An **agent environment** is where an agent operates and interacts.
🌍 **Types of Environments:**

1. **Fully Observable / Partially Observable:**

   * Full: Agent can see everything (e.g., chess).
   * Partial: Limited view (e.g., driving car).
2. **Deterministic / Stochastic:**

   * Deterministic: Same action → same result.
   * Stochastic: Outcome may vary.
3. **Static / Dynamic:**

   * Static: Environment doesn’t change while agent thinks.
   * Dynamic: Keeps changing.
4. **Discrete / Continuous:**

   * Discrete: Fixed steps (e.g., turn-based games).
   * Continuous: Smooth flow (e.g., driving).
5. **Single Agent / Multi-Agent:**

   * Single: Only one agent acts.
   * Multi: Many agents interact (e.g., football match).

### **Q7) What are the Different Types of Conceptual Dependency? (6 Marks)**

**Answer:**
**Conceptual Dependency (CD)** represents the meaning of a sentence using concepts instead of words.
🧩 **Types of Primitive Acts (Concepts):**

1. **ATRANS:** Transfer of possession (e.g., giving).
2. **PTRANS:** Physical transfer (e.g., going).
3. **PROPEL:** Physical action (e.g., pushing).
4. **MOVE:** Moving body part (e.g., raising hand).
5. **SPEAK:** Producing sound or communication.
6. **MTRANS:** Transfer of information (e.g., telling).
7. **INGEST:** Eating or drinking.
8. **EXPEL:** Removing something (e.g., exhaling).

---

### **Q8) Write a Short Note on Frame. (6 Marks)**

**Answer:**
A **Frame** is a data structure used to represent knowledge about objects, situations, or concepts in AI.
🧱 **Structure:**

* A frame contains **slots** (attributes) and **values** (data).
* Example:

  ```
  Frame: Dog
  Slots: 
    Type → Animal
    Sound → Bark
    Legs → 4
  ```

**Advantages:**

* Easy to update.
* Helps in inheritance (one frame can inherit from another).
* Used in expert systems and NLP.
